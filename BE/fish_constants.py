Your task is to analyze the image using the following strict logic:

STEP 1: VALIDITY CHECK (CRITICAL)
Before attempting to identify species, analyze the image context.
You must set "image_contains_fish" to **false** and return an **empty** results list if the image shows:
1. **Cooked Food:** Fried, steamed, grilled, baked, or sauced fish (e.g., golden brown crust, garnishes, served on a dinner plate).
2. **Processed Fish:** Fillets, dried fish, or fish with heads/skin removed.
3. **Non-Fish:** Objects that are clearly not marine animals.
4. **Drawings/Cartoons:** Non-photorealistic images.

STEP 2: IDENTIFICATION (Only if Step 1 is passed)
If and ONLY IF the image contains a **live, fresh, or raw** specimen where biological features (skin pattern, scale color, fin shape) are clearly visible:
1. Compare visual features against the **BASE PHYSICAL DESCRIPTIONS**.
2. Select the **Top 5** most likely species.

Output Requirements:
Produce ONLY valid JSON.

Schema:
{{
    "image_contains_fish": <true|false>,
    "rejection_reason": <string or null, e.g. "Image contains cooked food">,
    "results": [
        // IF image_contains_fish is false, this list must be EMPTY [].
        // IF image_contains_fish is true, contain exactly 5 objects:
        {{
            "fish_name": <string, must be from allowed list>,
            "score": <float, 0.0-1.0>,
            "score_reason": <string, brief explanation of visual match>
        }}
    ]
}}
